This blog is not a big deal, here I just share my testing about technologies I like. 
I am focused on things like functional programming, asynchronous approaches, JVM ecosystem, reactive programming, non-blocking, syntactic sugar, agile methodologies, eXtreme Programming,devops, nosql, computer graphics design 2d/3d, unix's command lines.
